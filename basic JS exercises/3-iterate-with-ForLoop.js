//Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
/* For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization statement, 
b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression

*/

//Use a for loop to push the values 1 through 5 onto myArray.

// Setup
const myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line

for (let i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
    myArray.push(i);
  }
